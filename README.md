# Secure Sharing of Text Based Data Using Hybrid Encryption Algorithms in a Client-Server Model

The current internet ecosystem has a variety of applications growing at a very fast pace. There exists a requirement to secure these applications to preserve the privacy of the users that employ its usage. This paper proposes a system to secure text-based data sharing between users using a hybrid encryption methodology. On the other hand, encryption algorithms consume a significant amount of time for computation. This paper provides an evaluation of 6 different algorithmic combinations: AES+RSA, DES+RSA, 3DES+RSA, RC4+RSA, Blowfish+RSA and Rabbit+RSA. A comparison study has been conducted for the different combinations by using files with different file sizes to determine which algorithmic combination is best for the proposed system. The simulation results have been published to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithmic combinations and suitability for the proposed system.
